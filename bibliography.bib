abstract="Power transformers are one of the main elements of a power grid, and their downtime impacts the entire network. Repairing their failures can be very costly, so sophisticated maintenance techniques are necessary. To attempt to solve this problem, we developed a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model that, focusing on a single power transformer, both schedules this maintenance and also decides how much of the hourly demand it will satisfy. A high level of load on a power transformer increases its temperature, which increases its degradation, and so these two decisions have to be carefully balanced. We also consider that power transformers have several components that degrade differently. Our model becomes very difficult to solve even in reasonably sized instances, so we also present an iterative refinement heuristic.",

  Abstract                 = {This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation. OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.},

While research on the combination of production-maintenance scheduling and production-resource scheduling is constantly increasing, limited research is available on the integration of all three aforementioned scheduling problems. To unite both research directions, this paper provides a detailed review on both the integration of maintenance and resource with production as well as a review on all three scheduling problems together. This paper is the first survey paper to provide an extensive review on the combinations of production, maintenance and resource scheduling of approximately 250 papers that have appeared until the end of 2020. We not only provide a concise summary of the conducted research, but also offer recommendations for future research directions guided by practical importance.}

abstract = {Remaining useful life (RUL) is the useful life left on an asset at a particular time of operation. Its estimation is central to condition based maintenance and prognostics and health management. RUL is typically random and unknown, and as such it must be estimated from available sources of information such as the information obtained in condition and health monitoring. The research on how to best estimate the RUL has gained popularity recently due to the rapid advances in condition and health monitoring techniques. However, due to its complicated relationship with observable health information, there is no such best approach which can be used universally to achieve the best estimate. As such this paper reviews the recent modeling developments for estimating the RUL. The review is centred on statistical data driven approaches which rely only on available past observed data and statistical models. The approaches are classified into two broad types of models, that is, models that rely on directly observed state information of the asset, and those do not. We systematically review the models and approaches reported in the literature and finally highlight future research challenges.}

An amount of k units of that resource can be allocated to the jobs at any time, and the more of that resource is allocated to a job, the smaller its processing time. The objective is to find a resource allocation and a schedule that minimizes the makespan. We explicitly allow for succinctly encodable time-resource tradeoff functions, which calls for mathematical programming techniques other than those that have been used before. Utilizing a (nonlinear) integer mathematical program, we obtain the first polynomial time approximation algorithm for the scheduling problem, with performance bound (3+ε) for any ε>0. Our approach relies on a fully polynomial time approximation scheme to solve the nonlinear mathematical programming relaxation. We also derive lower bounds for the approximation.}

    abstract = { A technique is presented for the decomposition of a linear program that permits the problem to be solved by alternate solutions of linear sub-programs representing its several parts and a coordinating program that is obtained from the parts by linear transformations. The coordinating program generates at each cycle new objective forms for each part, and each part generates in turn (from its optimal basic feasible solutions) new activities (columns) for the interconnecting program. Viewed as an instance of a “generalized programming problem” whose columns are drawn freely from given convex sets, such a problem can be studied by an appropriate generalization of the duality theorem for linear programming, which permits a sharp distinction to be made between those constraints that pertain only to a part of the problem and those that connect its parts. This leads to a generalization of the Simplex Algorithm, for which the decomposition procedure becomes a special case. Besides holding promise for the efficient computation of large-scale systems, the principle yields a certain rationale for the “decentralized decision process” in the theory of the firm. Formally the prices generated by the coordinating program cause the manager of each part to look for a “pure” sub-program analogue of pure strategy in game theory, which he proposes to the coordinator as best he can do. The coordinator finds the optimum “mix” of pure sub-programs (using new proposals and earlier ones) consistent with over-all demands and supply, and thereby generates new prices that again generates new proposals by each of the parts, etc. The iterative process is finite. }

A Proof-of-concept of scalable AI algorithm has been developed and field-verified, to demonstrate potential to implement "Just-in-time" (JIT) maintenance. The model has ability to absorb configuration variations; it is run on periodic basis, to reassess the findings, and identify changes in the operating behavior of the asset. It is a robust tool, for the field engineers.The objective of this research paper is to establish fundamentally different thought process for maintenance decision-makers for dynamic-diagnosis of faults using normal operating data. Each category of equipment has unique behavior, and hence must have customized solution. When linked through IIoT, the automated business decision for maintenance cost reduction can be applied on mass scale. The experimental results \\&amp; field validations show that AI based diagnostics methodology outperforms traditional maintenance cost-management practices. It is a system which is self-learning, and therefore, as the model matures, dynamic strategy will evolve; and maintenance cost saving can extend beyond targeted 4\\% of net operating cost. The concept can be equally applied for any data-intensive-complex machineries and static-assets (Heat exchanger, Pipeline, Rotating equipment, etc.) across process industries.}",
